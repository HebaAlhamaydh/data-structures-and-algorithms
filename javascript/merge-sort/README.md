## Merge Sort algorithm
 is a sorting algorithm that is considered an example of the divide and conquer strategy. So, in this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O: 
Time Complexity: O(n log(n)) Merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves
Space Complexity : O(n) N space is required for merge sort.
