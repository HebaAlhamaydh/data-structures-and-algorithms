## Hashtables
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

***left join*** returns all the values from the left table, plus matched values from the right table or NULL in case of no matching join predicate.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps
  - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
