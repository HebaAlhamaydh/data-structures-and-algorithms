## Hashtables
- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Approach & Efficiency
The big O => O(n) time.

The big O => O(n) space.
## API

Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string.
If there is no input, return No input.
If there are no words that occur more than once, return No repeated words.
- Arguments: string
- Return: string
