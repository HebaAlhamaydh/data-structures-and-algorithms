## Approach & Efficiency
The big O => O(n^2) time.recursion funtion

The big O => O(n) space.
## API
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters. Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

input : two binary tree
output :array contain same value in trees
